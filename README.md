# Marp Takahashi Theme

A Takahashi theme of [Marp]().

The style of the theme is heavily based on [joyqi/takahashi-template](https://github.com/joyqi/takahashi-template), and the final result is not much different.

So the [joyqi/takahashi-templat demo](https://joyqi.github.io/takahashi-template/page/2016-zufe.html) is also applicable to this theme, you can view the effect with the help of it.
